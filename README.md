# DNS-323: How to overcome the software / hardware limitations
Nowdays, the D-Link DNS-323 NAS is not supported anymore and the SMB protocol supports only the version 1. This is how I started the project: trying, at least, to obtain SMBv2.0. The saga is about failure and success: this method that the first part is not enough glorified.

# How to read
The repository is organized with two branches and the latest will be the final and master version. So, if you only want the instructions, just read next, otherwise, navigate through the branches and commmits.

# What you will obtain
- Debian Jessie as operating system
- SMBv3
- SSH connection to the hardware
- Overcome the 2TB limitation
- Possibility to add a USB 2.0 hub
- Automount / sharing of disk devices connected
- RAID-1 with failure detection that will warn you via email
- Fan control with failure detection that will warn you via email
- Printing server

# What you will lose
- The web interface to manage the hardware, but one could install something but may have to build it by him/herself.

# Lets start!
